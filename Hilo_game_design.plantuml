    card -> director

    note top of card
    This is the card class that will provide default value for each card object.
    >draw_card() will allow a random card to be drawn.
    end note

    note bottom of director
    This is where we will control the flow of the game.
    >start_game() will handle the path
    >get_inputs() gets the players guess of high or low
    >do_updates() will update the score and determine if it is game over
    >do_outputs() will display the results
    >play_again() will give the option to continue the game or not
    end note

}

note top of main
The main file will initilize the whole project.
